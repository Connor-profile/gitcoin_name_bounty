### Project Info
DeFi project allowing users to create portfolio indexes, and other users can join their portfolio.  Very similar to:
- [DHedge](https://www.dhedge.org/)
- [TokenSets](https://www.tokensets.com/)
- [PieDao](https://www.piedao.org/)

Major difference is user is in full control of their assets, and strong emphasis on social trading.

### Additional Info
Name does not have to be explicit for the particular product and can be abstract.  For example, we had went through names such as Bodhi, On-Chain, Stargate and Pathfinder.
